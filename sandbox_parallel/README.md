## Parrelizing

We attempted to parrelize our testing code so that we can have classification done in real time while playing a video. 
We evaluated various packages:

* [mpi4py](http://pythonhosted.org/mpi4py/usrman/index.html)
* [pypy](http://pypy.org/)
* [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing)
