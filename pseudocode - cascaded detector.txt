1) User select value for f, the maximum acceptable false positive rate per layer and d, the minimum acceptable detection

2) User selects target overall false positive rate, F_target

3) P = set of positive examples

4) N = set of negative examples

5) F_0 = 1.0; D_0 = 1.0

6) i = 0

7) while F[i] > F[target]:
		i += 1
		n[i] = 0; F[i] = F[i-1]

		while F[i] > f*F[i-1]: 
			n[i] += 1
			-Use P and N to train a classifier with n[i] features using AdaBoost
			-Evaluate current cascade classifier on validation set to determine F[i] and D[i]
			-Decrease threshold for the ith classifier until the current classifier has a detection rate of at least d x D[i-1] (this also affects F[i])
		N = 0
		If F[i] > F[target]:
			evaluate the current cascaded detector on the set of non-face images and put any false detections into the set N.
