### SVM

Ran SVM on color values of image on a small amount of training data for preliminary analsysis. Cross-validated training accuracy are

    Accuracy: 95.7  +- 3.2   (calculated in 3.4 seconds)
    Accuracy: 99.7  +- 0.4   (calculated in 9.7 seconds)
    Accuracy: 99.9  +- 0.1   (calculated in 12.2 seconds)
    Accuracy: 99.9  +- 0.1   (calculated in 10.4 seconds)
    Accuracy: 99.9  +- 0.1   (calculated in 22.7 seconds)
  
Reused most of the functions from [Martin BÃ¶schen](https://github.com/Safadurimo/cats-and-dogs/blob/master/catsdogs.ipynb)
